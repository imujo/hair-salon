# Hair Salon

The Hair Salon Website is a web development project featuring a home page, pricing page, and contact page for a fictional hair salon. The home page provides an overview of the salon's offerings, while the pricing page displays detailed information about services and costs. The contact page allows visitors to easily get in touch with the salon for appointments or inquiries.

## Project Goals

The primary objective of this project was to gain familiarity with new technologies and frameworks such as Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Server Components, and Contenful CMS. By developing this quick website, I aimed to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and best practices associated with these technologies. This hands-on experience would enable me to confidently utilize them in future, larger-scale projects. 

## Technologies Used

- `Next JS` - was used for it's SSR capabilities and because of it's strong market presence
- `Tailwind` - was used because of it's quick development time and ease of use, without having to learn an alternative paradigm to CSS
- `Contentful CMS` - was used for it's ease of use
- `Maintine Carousel` - for the team members carousel
- `Tanstack Table` - for the pricing table
- `Formik` - for the contact form
- `Yup` - for contact form validation
